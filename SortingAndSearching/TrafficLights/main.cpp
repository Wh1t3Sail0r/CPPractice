// There is a street of length x whose positions are numbered 0,1,…,x. Initially there are no traffic lights, but n sets of traffic lights are added to the street one after another.

// Your task is to calculate the length of the longest passage without traffic lights after each addition.

// Input

// The first input line contains two integers x and n: the length of the street and the number of sets of traffic lights.

// Then, the next line contains n integers p1,p2,…,pn: the position of each set of traffic lights. Each position is distinct.

// Output

// Print the length of the longest passage without traffic lights after each addition.

// Constraints
// 1≤x≤109
// 1≤n≤2⋅105
// 0<pi<x
// Example

// Input:
// 8 3
// 3 6 2

// Output:
// 5 3 3
